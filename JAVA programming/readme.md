## Basic Java Syntax
- **Main.java** - Basic structure of a Java program including the `main` method.
- **For_loop.java** - Demonstrates the use of `for` loops in Java.
- **While_loop.java** - Usage of `while` loops, with examples on loop conditions.
- **enhanced_loop.java** - Shows how to use the enhanced `for` loop (for-each) for easier array traversal.
- **Switch.java** - Demonstrates the `switch` statement with various case examples.
- **New_Switch.java** - Java's new switch expressions introduced in recent Java versions.
- **Switch_as_expression.java** - Uses `switch` as an expression to return values directly.

## Control Flow
- **Dynamic_method_dispatch.java** - Example of dynamic method dispatch, demonstrating polymorphism by calling overridden methods at runtime.
- **upcasting_downcasting.java** - Shows how to perform upcasting and downcasting with objects in Java.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **A.java** & **A$B.class** - Basic classes to demonstrate structure and compilation in Java.
- **overriding.java** - Covers method overriding in Java, with examples showing how subclasses can provide specific implementations of superclass methods.
- **getter_setter.java** - Demonstrates encapsulation through getter and setter methods.
- **anonymous_object.java** - Introduction to anonymous objects, objects that are created and used without storing a reference.
- **super_this.java** - Examples of `super` and `this` keywords to access superclass members and current object references.

## Advanced OOP Concepts
- **inner_class.java** & **inner_class.class** - Demonstrates inner classes in Java and how they work within the outer class.
- **Multiple_Inheritance.java** - Explanation and example of achieving multiple inheritance through interfaces in Java.

## Interfaces and Abstract Classes
- **Abstract_key.java** & **Abstract_key.class** - Explains the concept of abstract classes and abstract methods in Java.
- **Interfaces.java** & **Interfaces.class** - Introduction to interfaces in Java, including syntax and implementation.
- **More_About_Interface.java** & **More_About_Interface.class** - Covers advanced interface concepts, including default methods and multiple inheritance.
- **Need_interface.java** - Demonstrates the need for interfaces and their role in Java's type system.

## Enums and Enhanced Switch
- **Enum.java** - Shows how to use enums for defining a fixed set of constants.
- **Final.java** - Demonstrates the use of the `final` keyword to create constants, prevent inheritance, and prevent method overriding.
- **format_presentation.java** - Provides examples of how to format output in Java using `String.format` and other methods.
  
## More Enums
- **More_Enum.java** - This file demonstrates advanced usage of enums, showcasing how they can be utilized for more complex scenarios, including methods within enums and their integration with other Java features.
